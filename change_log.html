      <h2>Dust Version 0.5.0</h2>
      <div class='no_top'><i>27 December, 2020</i></div>
      <div class='log_description'>The version 0.5 of "Dust : The Abandoned Land" is the largest update so far. It introduces (1) online multiplayer, (2) the training area,  (3) a new starting scenario, (4) a game manual , and (5) many new small features and improvements.<br />
<br />
First, the multiplayer! You can now play with other players over the internet. Like with split-screen multiplayer, you can play together or again with each other. Note: Split-screen multiplayer  can be combined with multiplayer over the internet.<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3TOq0ZgfYw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
In the training camp, you can try all the weapons, enrolling and giving orders to human NPCs, and fighting monsters, robots,  soldiers and other survivors  in an arena (or make them fight each other and watch). Bonus: The training camp also works for multiplayer.<br />
<br />

<br />
In the new scenario "in house with my family", you start in your house as the chef of the family. It is up to you to figure how to keep it safe (or to send them fighting for you).<br />
<br />

      <div class='no_top'><i>01 October, 2020</i></div>
      <div class='log_description'>Dust v0.4.1 uses LWJGL3 (compared to LWJGL2  used by previous versions) and supports the last versions of OpenJDK on linux.</div>

      <h2>Dust Version 0.4.0</h2>
      <div class='no_top'><i>26 September, 2020</i></div>
      <div class='log_description'>The v0.4.0 introduces vehicles to Dust, a new procedural world generator, an improved procedural house generator, and many smaller improvements.<br />
<br />
First, the bike. It is not much, but if you find one (and can repair it), you will have a much better chance to escape large hordes of enemies, navigate faster between cities (avoiding night travel), and keep more loot with you. <br />
<br />
<center><br />
<img src="https://dust.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/image/release_0.4.0/bike_2.gif"><br />
</center><br />
<br />
Crashing into things with the bike is not recommended, but it can have some use :).<br />
<br />
<center><br />
<img src="https://dust.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/image/release_0.4.0/bike_1.gif"><br />
</center><br />
<br />
This release also introduces a completely re-written procedural world generator. The generation of the world is faster, and the placement of locations (e.g. cities, laboratory, military camps, monster encounters) is more organic. It should make for more interesting games.<br />
<br />
<center><br />
<img src="https://dust.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/image/release_0.4.0/zoom_cropped.gif"><br />
</center><br />
<br />
Within the house generator for sub-urban cities has also been improved for better diversity.<br />
<br />
<center><br />
<img src="https://dust.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/image/release_0.4.0/house_generator.gif"><br />
</center><br />
<br />
<b>Features</b><br />
- Bikes. Allow to move around quickly, avoid troubles and store a few items. Can be equipped with a flashlight to see in the dark.<br />
- New procedural work generator (faster, more organic).<br />
- Improved and more diverse procedural house generator.<br />
- Pre-generated world (so you can start playing immediately).<br />
- Street lights in cities and highways.<br />
- New main screen.<br />
- "Broken car" scenario cannot start in a snow-covered city.<br />
- Shops have signs showing what they are selling.<br />
- Ripped clothes are removed.<br />
- Reduce the amount of liquid used in most crafting recipes.<br />
- Monsters cannot appear near you when you first spawn in the world.<br />
<b>Fixes</b><br />
- Placement of displayed time when wearing a watch.<br />
- Rendering radius in the morning.<br />

    <div class='log'>
      <h2>Dust Version 0.3.0</h2>
      <div class='no_top'><i>01 May, 2020</i></div>
      <div class='log_description'>The v0.3.0 release of Dust introduces a new mid-game location, with new enemies, weapons, challenges and strategies: The research laboratory.<br />
<br />
Scanners are static robots equipped with homing explosive rockets. Unlike other robots, scanners sense their surroundings with 4 scanning lasers. They can be used to the player's advantage to destroy pests.<br />
<br />
<center><br />
<img src="https://dust.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/image/rush_scanner.gif"><br />
</center><br />
<br />
<br />
Sentinel are flying patrolling robots equipped with a close range taser gun. While relatively weak, they have the tendency to ”gang up” on enemies and alter other, more dangerous robots.<br />
<br />
<center><br />
<img src="https://dust.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/image/rush_sentinel.gif"><br />
</center><br />
<br />
Tanks are slow heavy armored robots equipped with a high range, high rate plasma weapon. Unless you have a good cover and a high dps weapon, it is better to leave them alone.<br />
<br />
<center><br />
<img src="https://dust.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/image/rush_tank.gif"><br />
</center><br />
<br />
The laser rifle (inspired from some popular shows :) ) is a powerful but resource hungry weapon. It is able to kill most enemies and destroy most material in seconds. It is effective both on large enemies or swarms of small enemies.<br />
<br />
<center><br />
<img src="https://dust.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/image/rush_laser.gif"><br />
</center><br />
<br />
<b>New Features<b><br />
- Research laboratories: Mid game locations infested with robots and wildlife.<br />
- Three new enemy types: sentinel robot, rank robot and scanner robot.<br />
- Laser rifle weapon: Late game overpowered weapons able to take down large numbers of strong enemies. Consumes a large amount of energy i.e. consumes a fully charged standard battery in <1s. Integrates well with nuclear batteries.<br />
- Robotic factories: To craft friendly robots.<br />
- Spider pheromone (previously called “spider love potion”) is effective on large spiders.<br />
- Spider pheromone is effective on small spiders, even when a large spider is around.<br />
- The light radius of most light emitting items (torches, fire camps, luminous plants, etc.) have been increased.<br />
- Eyes of large spiders are visible in the dark.<br />
- Lag when loading / generating new chunks of the world is significantly reduced.<br />
- When starting a new game, the world generation is faster.<br />
- New explosion effects.<br />
- Weak rocks (located in abandoned caves) are easier to break.</div>

    <a id='v0.2.0'></a>
    <div class='log'>
      <h2>Dust Version 0.2.0</h2>
      <div class='no_top'><i>22 February, 2020</i></div>
      <div class='log_description'>Dust v0.2.0 adds support for the mouse for aiming and in menus (e.g. inventory, crating). This makes the game feel more reactive and more familiar to many players (Cogmind + mouse, Terraria, CS, etc. :) ). The release also re-balances some mechanics and solves a couple of bugs (see change logs).<br />
<br />
<center><br />
<img src="https://dust.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/articles/aiming.gif"><br />
</center><br />
<br />
<b>Features</b><br />
- Support for the mouse for aiming and in menus. The wheel changes the item in hand.<br />
- Move slower when moving backward.<br />
- Display item / mob / terrain name by putting the mouse on top of it.<br />
- Add icons in game menus.<br />
- Adapt the game “game / screen pixel ratio” automatically. You can still control it manually.<br />
- Still show the current tutorial message when a menu is open.<br />
- Improve / re-balance the spawning rate and count of survivors, bandits, prisoners and military units in cities.<br />
- Reduced the probability for someone to wake up when pick-pocketed from 50% to 25%.<br />
<br />
<b>Fix</b><br />
- The game doesn't crash when looking at Polaroid pictures.<br />
- Spider eggs can be destroyed with ranged weapons (e.g. guns).<br />
- Survivors can equip backpacks.<br />
- Survivors will store extra ranged weapons in the base for their teammates to take.<br />
- Survivors won’t keep large stacks of items of the same type in the inventory. Instead, survivors will only keep a small amount (depending on the item) and store the others in the base.<br />

- Can read books and consume items directly, without having to have it in the inventory.<br />
